### Good Morning! I'm Jose ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior at WashU pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering and a BS in Computer Science. Since high school, I have developed a passion for helping people in any way I can, whether it be volunteering or building applications for people to use. Feel free to take a look at some of my projects! Reach out to me at josefolgar1232@gmail.com for any inquiries or if you're ever interested in working with me!
